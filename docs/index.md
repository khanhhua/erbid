## Problem Statement

Imagine you have a store of a few products, or handy-crafts, or an unsteady supply of items... So you publish these items
on a webpage using Github page with little effort.

Imagine you want to auctionize a few of these items, hoping to sell them at the best price possible. However, you would
have to publish to an auction platform such as eBay.com where you would compete with the unwanted competitors. Besides, you
cannot truly customize the look'n'feel of your given storefront.

However, you do not want to lose control over the look'n'feel of your storefront. You don't want to redirect your potential
customers to another domain.
